# Wells Cargo

A simple web app created with servlets and JSP for users to manage money transfer and balances between their accounts. It maintains sessions and a persistent database

## Getting Started

The project was built in IntelliJ so it's highly recommended to use IntelliJ to build and run. It utilizes Maven and Tomcat to run a local server. You will have to configure tomcat path with IntelliJ before you can run. I used Tomcat 8.5.29 for it.
